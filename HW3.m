%% Problem 1 - Smith-Waterman alignment
% Consider two sequences 'GTAATCC' and 'GTATCCG'

% Construct the scoring matrix for this with the parameters:
% match value = 2, mismatch value = -1, and gap penalty = -1. Use your
% solution to get the optimal alignment. If you prefer, it is acceptable to do this with
% pencil and paper, you can then take a snapshot of your solution and
% include it in your repository. 
matchval=2;
mismatchval=-1;
ofdiag=ones(4)-eye(4);
S=matchval*eye(4)+mismatchval*ofdiag;
seq1='GTAATCC';
seq2='GTATCCG';
figure;
[score,align,start]=swalign(seq1,seq2,'Alphabet','nt','ScoringMatrix',S,'Gapopen',1,'Showscore',true);

%% Problem 2 - using the NCBI databases and sequence alignments

% Erk proteins are critical signal transducers of MAP kinase signaling.
% Accessions numbers for ERK1 (also called MAPK3) and ERK2 (also called MAPK1) human mRNA are NM_002746 and
% NM_002745, respectively. 

% Part 1. Perform an alignment of the coding DNA sequences of ERK1 and
% ERK2. What fraction of base pairs in ERK1 can align to ERK2? 

% Part2. Perform an alignment of the aminoacid sequences of ERK1 and ERK2.
% What fraction of amino acids align?

% Part 3.  Use the NCBI tools to get mRNA sequences for the mouse genes ERK1 and
% ERK2 and align both the coding DNA sequences and protein sequences to the
% human versions. How similar are they? 

%% Problem 3: using blast tools programatically

% Part 1. Write a function that takes an NCBI accession number and a number N as input and
% returns a cell array of the accession numbers for the top N blast hits. 

% Part 2. Write a function that takes an accession number as input, calls your function 
% from part 1, and returns two outputs - the closest scoring match in human DNA/RNA and the
% closest non-human match. Hint: see the "Source" or "SourceOrganism" field in the data
% returned by getgenbank. Make sure your function does something sensible
% if nothing human is found. 

% Part 3. Choose at least one gene from the human genome and one gene from
% another organism and run your code from part 2 on the relevant accession
% numbers. Comment on the results.
